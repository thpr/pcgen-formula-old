 * An InvalidSemantics error represents a situation where a visitor encountered
 * an item it cannot process in a sensible fashion (it cannot operate on that
 * item because it is not a number and a number is required for the given
 * operation).

 * As an example, the operation: "min(4<5,6)" will trigger an InvalidSemantics
 * error as "4<5" does not return a numeric value (it returns a Boolean
 * TRUE/FALSE).
 * 
 * This is usually an indication of a user error where a Boolean operation was
 * used in a function where a numeric calculation is required.
